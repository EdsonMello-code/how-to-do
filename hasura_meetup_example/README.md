# hasura_meetup_example

Flutter project to demonstrate the integration between Flutter and [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) using the [Hasura Connect package](https://pub.dev/packages/hasura_connect).

## Getting Started

This app was made for a presentation at [Flutterando](https://www.youtube.com/user/jacobaraujo7), the biggest Brazillian Flutter community on youtube. It covers queries and subscriptions with filters using the change variable method. You can see the presentation clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtrEq55EFC4&t=541s).

## Steps

 - [Deploy a hasura server](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/heroku.html)
 - [Create a table called "employees" with two columns: id (integer auto-increment) and name (text)](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/tables.html)
 - Run the project and set the **HASURA URL** and **HASURA ADMIN SECRET** in it.
